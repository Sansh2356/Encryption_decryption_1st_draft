A prime number is an integer greater than 1
, which has exactly two divisors. For example, 7
 is a prime, since it has two divisors {1,7}
. A composite number is an integer greater than 1
, which has more than two different divisors.

Note that the integer 1
 is neither prime nor composite.

Let's look at some composite number v
. It has several divisors: some divisors are prime, others are composite themselves. If the number of prime divisors of v
 is less or equal to the number of composite divisors, let's name v
 as strongly composite.

For example, number 12
 has 6
 divisors:
